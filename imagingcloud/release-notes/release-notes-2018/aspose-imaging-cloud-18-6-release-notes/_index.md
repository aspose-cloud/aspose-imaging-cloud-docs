## **API changes**
Adjusted versioning according to the latest requirements.

Along with this release, we introduce new AI features integration, which include:

- Content-based image search
- Image duplicates search
- Image search by custom registered tags
- Image comparison and similarity detection
- Image features extraction (for now, AKAZE detector is supported)

[APIs' Reference page](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/imaging/) will let you test these APIs directly in the browser.

The default API version is now 2.0, so [SDKs](https://github.com/aspose-imaging-cloud) update is needed to use the latest one.
#### **Aspose.Imaging Cloud SDK changes**
Signature authentication has been removed to encourage usage of OAuth 2.0.

Aspose.Imaging AI features are represented in the [SDK](https://github.com/aspose-imaging-cloud).
