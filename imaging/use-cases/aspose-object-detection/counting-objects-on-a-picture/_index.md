One common task is to calculate the number of objects on the picture. For example, there may be a need to count people that participate in an event or calculate the number of cars on the parking lot to take certain security measures. For example, a developer could implement an application that regularly takes pictures via a web camera and makes requests to Aspose Object Detection API to calculate the number of people on it. A developer could request for a JSON response to further analyze and filter the result or request a resulting image to append it to a paper report, for instance. You can read more about the resulting JSON in our blog.

Additionally, a developer could use Aspose.Imaging library to crop the detected object from the input image.
