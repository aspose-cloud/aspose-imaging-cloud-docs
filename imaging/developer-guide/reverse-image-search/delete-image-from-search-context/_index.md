# **Introduction**
This article explain how to delete image and image features from search context. The API URL is:

[DELETE /imaging/ai/imageSearch/{searchContextId}/image](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/imaging/#/SearchContextImages/DeleteSearchImage)
## **Resource URI**
[Swagger UI](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/imaging/#/SearchContextImages/DeleteSearchImage) lets you call Aspose.Imaging REST APIs directly from the browser. The description of the APIs and their parameters are also given there.
## **cURL Example**
{{< tabs tabTotal="2" tabID="1" tabName1="Request" tabName2="Response" >}}

{{< tab tabNum="1" >}}

```java

// First get Access Token
// Get App Key and App SID from https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/

curl -v "https://api.aspose.cloud/oauth2/token" \
-X POST \
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=xxxx&client_secret=xxxx' \

# **SDKs**
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project. Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-imaging-cloud) for a complete list of Aspose.Imaging SDKs along with working examples, to get you started in no time.
