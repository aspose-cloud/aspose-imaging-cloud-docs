## **Aspose.Imaging Cloud SDKs**

Aspose.Imaging Cloud is to provide the-all new API wrappers (SDKs) for different languages and platforms, which allow using web API features directly from the code.

## **Why use an SDK?**

Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project.

## **SDK benefits**

Our supported SDKs are 100% tested and out of the box running. These SDKs are open source and have an MIT license. You can use them, and even customize them for absolutely free of charge.

## **Versioning Support in SDKs**

[Aspose.Imaging Cloud SDKs](https://github.com/aspose-imaging-cloud) have "ApiVersion" property for API Configuration classes. The current version is v3.0 and we strongly discourage using v2.0 and lower.
